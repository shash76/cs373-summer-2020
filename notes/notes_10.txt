•	build NaturalJoin
NaturalJoin marries rows from two relations when columns of common attributes have same values.
r = [{"A" : 1, "B" : 4, "C" : 7},
       {"A" : 2, "B" : 5, "C" : 8},
       {"A" : 3, "B" : 6, "C" : 9}] # attributes A, B and C

s = [{"A" : 2, "B" : 4, "D" : 7}, # attributes A, B and D
       {"A" : 3, "B" : 5, "D" : 5},
       {"A" :  3, "B" : 6, "D" : 6},
       {"A" :  4, "B" : 7, "D" : 6}]
NaturalJoin(r, s) = [{'A' :  3, 'B' : 6, 'C' : 9, 'D' : 6}]
 # r and share the attributes "A" and "B", therefore we will marry the two rows that has the same values
# for these two attributes. row #3 of r and row # 3 of s.
naturaljoin(r,s): marry rows from two relations when col of commnon attributes have the same value.
Note:
-----
(1) in case of no common attributes between r and s, naturaljoin will do cross join
(2) in case of common attributes but no common values, naturaljoin will do nothing.
(3) in case of common attributes with common values, naturaljoin will return the common values. 
------------------------------
Note:
def bp (u, v) :
    return not any(u[k] != v[k] *for* k in u *if* k in v) # can be replaced with "retrun all(u[k] == v[k] ...)"

This predicate return true when two rows, u and v, have equal values for the same attributes, 
False, otherwise.
Note that in case of the two rows have completely different attributes, bp will return true.

This predicate will return true in two cases. First when there are no common attributes between the two input dictionaries or when all the common attributes have the same value.
It will return false if there is at least one common attribute with different value.
