Tail Recursion: 
In traditional recursion, the typical model is that you perform your recursive calls first, and then you take 
the return value of the recursive call and calculate the result. In this manner, you don't get the result of 
your calculation until you have returned from every recursive call.

In tail recursion, you perform your calculations first, and then you execute the recursive call, passing 
the results of your current step to the next recursive step. This results in the last statement being in 
the form of "(return (recursive-function params))" (I think that's the syntax for Lisp). Basically, the 
return value of any given recursive step is the same as the return value of the next recursive call.

The consequence of this is that once you are ready to perform your next recursive step, you don't need 
the current stack frame any more. This allows for some optimization. In fact, with an appropriately written 
compiler, you should never have a stack overflow snicker with a tail recursive call. Simply reuse the current 
stack frame for the next recursive step. I'm pretty sure Lisp does this.

Example:
-------
Tail recursion is well-described in previous answers, but I think an example in action would help to illustrate the concept.

Consider a simple function that adds the first N integers. (e.g. sum(5) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15).

Here is a simple Python implementation that uses recursion:

def recsum(x):
 if x == 1:
  return x
 else:
  return x + recsum(x - 1)
If you called recsum(5), this is what the Python interpreter would evaluate.

recsum(5)
5 + recsum(4)
5 + (4 + recsum(3))
5 + (4 + (3 + recsum(2)))
5 + (4 + (3 + (2 + recsum(1))))
5 + (4 + (3 + (2 + 1)))
15
Note how every recursive call has to complete before the Python interpreter begins to actually do the work of calculating the sum.

Here's a tail-recursive version of the same function:

def tailrecsum(x, running_total=0):
  if x == 0:
    return running_total
  else:
    return tailrecsum(x - 1, running_total + x)
Here's the sequence of events that would occur if you called tailrecsum(5), (which would effectively be tailrecsum(5, 0), because of the default second argument).

tailrecsum(5, 0)
tailrecsum(4, 5)
tailrecsum(3, 9)
tailrecsum(2, 12)
tailrecsum(1, 14)
tailrecsum(0, 15)
15
In the tail-recursive case, with each evaluation of the recursive call, the running_total is updated.

Note: As mentioned in the comments, Python doesn't have built-in support for optimizing away tail calls, so there's no advantage to doing this in Python. 
However, you can use a decorator to achieve the optimization
