Python iterables must implement one special methods, __iter__(). the "__iter__" magic function is called, 
for example, when a for-loop starts. 

Python iterator object must implement two special methods, __iter__() and __next__().

An object is called iterable if we can get an iterator from it. 
Most of built-in containers in Python like: list, tuple, string etc. are iterables.

The iter() function (which in turn calls the __iter__() method) returns an iterator from them.

Range and RangeIterator: 
------------------------
In RangeIteratorT we see that range_iterator_class and range_iterator_function 
are imported meaning we can implement the rangeIterator functionality 
in both a class and a function.
 
In RangeT we see that range_1, and range_2 are imported. More importantly 
on lines 50-51 list() is called twice and we get a new iterator both times! 
This logic can't be done in a function, meaning we need to make
 a class that responds to __iter__().

 
Range_2:
-------
Range_2 in Range.py is trying to implement a range function that is not exhaustible. 
This is can be easily achieved by not updating the instance variables b and e.
Instead you create two local variables and update them. Doing this, will keep the 
original b and e as they were when the object was initially created, and therefore,
each time you list the object, you get the same sequence of numbers (i.e., not exhaustibale).

Note that a range object is an iterable but not iterator
>>> x = range(4)
>>> hasattr(x, "__iter__")
True
>>> hasattr(x, "__next__")
False
>>> 

Range_1:
-------
Rabge_1 in Range.py accomplishes the same outcome of Range_2 but using inner classes.
Inner class is a class that is defined inside another class. 
Whenever you create an object of Range_1, you need to pass two variables, namely b and e.
Afterward, whenever you try to navigate this object, You'll get an 
instance of the inner class with the original variable values.
