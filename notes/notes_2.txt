- coverage:
     Test coverage or code coverage is used to measure the percent of your code covered by a test. 
     Coverage testing only checks whether or not a test is present. It does not check the quality of the test.

     --branch: to activate branch coverage otherwise only statement coverage is measured
     -m flag: shows the line number of missing statements

Coverage output:
     Stmts, or code statements, indicate the number of lines of code that could be tested.
     Miss, or Missed lines, indicates the number of lines that are not executed by the unit tests. 
     Branch: number of possible branches
     BrPart: number of branches that were executed during tests
     Cover, or Coverage, is the percentage of code covered by the current tests 
        (equivalent to [(Stmts+Branch) - (Miss+(Branch-BrPart))]/[Stmts+Branch]).
     Missing: missing lines (and branches)
