Decorators:
----------
A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and adds some kind of functionality, 
and returns another function, all of this without altering the source code of the original function 
that you passed in.

Example:
def decorator_function(original_function):
	def wrapper_function():
		print('wrapper executed this before display')     
		return original_function() 
	return wrapper_function

@decorator_function # equivalent to "display = decorator_function(display)"
def display():
	print('display function ran')

display()

# output: 
wrapper executed this before display
display function ran

Note: when stacking two decorators (from top to bottom), the lower decorator is executed first.

Why?
Decorating our functions allows us to easily add functionality to our existing functions 
by adding that functionality inside the wrapper.

def post_gtz (f) :
    def g (n) :
        v = f(n)
        assert v > 0
        return v
    return g

The function post_gtz performs the work of "f" and get the result to check if its > 0. 
It transforms a function "f" to a function that checks if output greater than zero. 
That function to be returned is "g". You can think of "g" as a wrapper of "f", 
it calls "f" in its body then check if the result if greater than 0.

cache_1 and cahe_2
------------------
DecoratorsT.py shows the test cases to build a cache to store the cycle lengths.
The cache, cache_1, receives a function, f, and returns a function, g. cache_1 utilizes a cache, d.  
Every time cache_1(f) is called, d and g are allocated and occupy their own memory locations, 
so when g is returned you now have a function that acts as wrapper for f that utilizes a unique cache.
