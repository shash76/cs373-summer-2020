Phase II of Project #1:
----------------------
You need to do the following.
(1) Fix the unit tests in TestCollatz.py
    
	- Valid maximum cycle length values can be obtained using Collatz Calculator at
	https://www.udebug.com/UVa/100
	will calculate max cycle length for up to 10,000.

	scroll down until you see the window titled "input".
	Inside the window, type in intervals such as
	1 10
	2 20
	Then scroll down and hit the button "Get Accepted Output".
	The output will be displayed in the window underneath the button to the left.
    
	- Another option is to use this file 
	https://gitlab.com/fareszf/collatz_calculator/-/blob/master/collatz.pyc
	On *UTCS machines*, the comamand is:

	python3 collatz.pyc < input > output
	
	where input is a text file of the inputs and ouput is a location for output. 
	This is compiled on a CS machine so it will work there. It may also work elsewhere.

(2) Run the unit tests 
    This can be achieved in many ways by either: 

    2.1 - "make tests"
    You may receive an error message as follows:
    "make: *** [TestCollatz.tmp] Error 1"

    Where can you check to see what went wrong?

    Note: Each time you need to run "make test", you need to run "make clean".

    2.2 - "python TestCollatz.py"

(3) Fix the method "collatz_eval" in "Collatz.py" by providing the correct implementation.

(4) Fix the acceptance tests in "RunCollatz.out" and "RunCollatz.in"
    You may use the Collatz Calculator mentions in (1).

(5) After fixing unit tests, "collatz_eval", and acceptance tests, 
    run "make test" (remember to run "make clean" before you run "make test.)

(6) RunCollatz.out: you may need to mannually update this file after you finish 
    each phase of the project. This file represents acceptance tests and 
	must have correspondence with RunCollatz.in. Can be created using the online 
	Collatz calculator mentioned in (1). 

(7) TestCollatz.out: you need to manually update this file after you finish each phase of the project

$ mv TestCollatz.tmp TestCollatz.out

(8) Continuous integration:
    Is the process of automatically building and testing your code.

    - Building and integrating the code will be performed on GitLab.
    - To inform GitLab to perform continuous intgeration, you need to include 
    a file ".gitlab-ci.yml" in your project's folder.
    - If the file ".gitlab-ci.yml" exists in your project's folder and contains the proper
    instructions, then each time you push to remote, gitlab will automatically build and test your code. 

    Files that starts with a "." are hidden files. If you use the "ls" command, 
	you may not be able to see them. You may use "ls -al" instead.

(9) ".gitignore"
    It contains a list of files you want git to avoid pushing them to remote. 
    For example, In Mac OS, ".DS_Store" hidden files exists in all your directories 
    You want git to ignore them, so you add ".DS_Store" as a line in ".gitignore"
