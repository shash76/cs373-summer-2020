Project #1: Phase I:
-------------------
Note that, in project 1, you'll work with two projects (or repos):
- public code repo: https://gitlab.com/fareszf/cs373-collatz.git
- public test repo: https://gitlab.com/fareszf/cs373-collatz-tests.git

In Phase #1 of the project, you need to understand the struture and relationships among the given files.
Project structure: 
(1) Kernel: Collatz.py
- Collatz_solve(r, w)
- Collatz_eval(i, j)
- w.write(): writes a string to a writer, w.

(2) Run Harness: RunCollatz.py
- Sys.stdin: keyboard
- Sys.stdout: console
- RunCollatz.py < RunCollatz.in > RunCollatz.out
RunCollatz.py will receive input from RunCollatz.in (rather than from the keyboard)
and will forward the output to RunCollatz.out (rather than to the console)

(3) Test Harness: TestCollatz.py
Tests the methods in Collatz.py
Read, eval, print, and solve
r = StringIO("...") read from
w = StringIO() write to
StringIO implements a file-like class that reads and writes a string buffer.
w.getvalue(): reads a string from a file.

(4) Unit tests vs acceptance tests
acceptance tests are a form of black box testing
unit tests are a form of white box testing

Unit tests and acceptance tests only check valid inputs.

(5) Requirements.txt
Pip freeze > requirements.txt

(6) .gitlab-ci.yml
You need to have this file in the root of your repo, each time you push, it will automatically trigger 
your CI pipeline.
