•	build project 
Another operation is project.
movies = [{"name" : "shane", "year" : 1949, "genre" : "western", "director" : "george stevens"},
                 {"name" : "star wars", "year" : "1977", "genre" : "western", "director" : "george lucas"}]

project(movies, "year", "name", "genre")  # this means that we need 3 out of 4 subset of column.

def project (r, *t)

•	 build CrossJoin
CrossJoin (r, s): 
CrossJoin combines 
the first row of r with all rows of s, 
the second row of r with all rows of s, 
....
Cross-Join(r,s)
Note: dict constructor receives two dictionaries and returns one dictionary that results from combining first with the unpacking of the second.
e.g., 
d1 = {}
d2 = {}
d3 = dict(d1, **d2)
Note:
(1) d = {1: 'one', 2: 'two'} is possible, but, obviously, dict(1='one' ...) is not.
(2) when applying dict on d1 and d2 where both have two identical key values, the value of d2 is taken.
(3) When using dict constructor with dictionaries that has integer keys, we receive an error.
# error
>>> d1 = {1 : "one", 2 : "two"}
>>> d2 = {3 : "Three", 4 : "Four"}
>>> d3 = dict(d1, **d2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: keyword arguments must be strings

# no error - replace integers with strings.
>>> d1 = {"1" : "one", "2" : "two"}
>>> d2 = {"3" : "Three", "4" : "Four"}
>>> dict(d1, **d2)
{'3': 'Three', '4': 'Four', '1': 'one', '2': 'two'}
>>>


•	build ThetaJoin
ThetaJoin joins corresponding rows given certain conditions.
E.g., Given two relations:
r with 3 rows
s with 4 rows
lambda u, v : u["A"] == v["C"]
u: a row from the first relations r
v: a row from the second relation v
u["A"]: the value of the attribute "A" in u
v["C"]: the value of the attribute "C" in v
